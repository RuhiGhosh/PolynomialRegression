# PolynomialRegression

The main objecive here is to experimenting with Polynomial Regression 
Understanding how polynomial regression works with a fixed sample size and various sample size. 
To understand how regression line will look from small to large sample size of data 
To see how test error behaves with increase of sample size for a fixed degree of polynomial regression 
How diffrent degrees of polynomial behave for fixed sample size.
Also, to understand how the root mean square of train and test error will behave while increasing the model comlexity.
